# Refactor Contacts App
Refactor employee grid from previous assignment to use Backbone.Collection and Backbone.View. 

Requirements:
When all (or none) are selected then it should show all the employees
Otherwise show only the employees from the selected departments
assign a font awesome icon for each department. Put this icon in each employee row in the list, and also put it 
next to each checkbox.
add a start date for each employee in your data, and use moment to format it for display in your view
make the entire thing look like a polished application. You can give it a false name like "Acme Corp", a 
non functioning set of utility links, or whatever you want. Have fun with the design.
feel free to add any additional fields to each employee that you think will make it better (like an avatar) 
but not required.
