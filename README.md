# Refactor Contacts App
Refactor employee grid from previous assignment to use Backbone.Collection and Backbone.View. 

Requirements:
When all (or none) are selected then it should show all the employees  
Otherwise show only the employees from the selected departments  
Add a start date for each employee in your data, and use moment to format it for display in your view  
Make the entire thing look like a polished application.  
Feel free to add any additional fields to each employee that you think will make it better
